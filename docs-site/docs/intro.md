# PersonalFinance Telegram Guide

Welcome to the end-user manual for the PersonalFinance Telegram bot.
If you live in Telegram and just want a fast way to record expenses, check wallet balances, and stay on top of debts, you're in the right place.

This guide focuses entirely on the chat experience—no API jargon or server setup.

You'll learn:

- how onboarding works and what the bot needs from you
- the core commands and shortcuts for day-to-day finance tracking
- how wallets, receipts, reports, and reminders fit together
- what safety checks exist (like wallet deletion safeguards)
- where to look when something feels off

Browse using the sidebar or follow the chapters in order.  
Whenever you see inline code like `/wallet list`, send it directly to the bot chat.
